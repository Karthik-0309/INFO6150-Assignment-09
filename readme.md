# Job Management Portal

## Project Overview

The **Job Management Portal** is a full-stack web application designed to connect job seekers with employers. It features a **React-based frontend** for an interactive user interface and a **Node.js backend** for managing server-side logic and data operations.

This project demonstrates the integration of frontend and backend components to create a cohesive web application.
